This is the repo for our May 2014 London NHS hackday project.

We wanted to compare measles incidence rates and MMR vaccination coverage, sorted by geographical area. This was going to be in a nice javascript/D3 framework.

One of the big problems we had was in the structure of the data. The geographical areas for the vaccination coverage changed between 1997-2001 and 2002-onwards. 

Another of the big problems was the D3 is hard.

The current state of the project is that area.incidence and area.coverage have some useful data in.

There is vaccine coverage data here http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733783627

The map_mapping.xlsx is the start of a link between the pre-2001 data and the post-2001 data. Good luck!
